# Data syntax

Syntax of base data types.

## Number

Similar to `float`s and `int`s in Python. Including allowing underscores to
improve readability.

Some examples of valid numbers are:

```equator
1
-15
1_234_567
4.2
1.7e+12
```

## Boolean

The only valid booleans are:

```equator
true
false
```

## String

Similar to other languages. Some examples of valid strings are:

```equator
"Hello, world"
'Hello, world'
```
