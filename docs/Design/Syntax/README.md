# Syntax design

Equator's syntax is designed to combine familiar designs from popular
programming languages with elegant mathematical expression.

## Basics

Code is scoped using `{` braces `}`.

Statements are separated using semicolons `;`.

Inline comments are written using double slashes `//`.

Multi-line comments are opened using a slash followed by a star `/*` and closed
with a star followed by a slash `*/`.

## Keywords

`if` - simple if statement.

`else` - else component of if statement.

`when` - when statement.

`while` - while loop.

`whilst` - whilst loop (if I can wrap my brain around it).

`equation` - declare an equation.

`relation` - declare a relation.
